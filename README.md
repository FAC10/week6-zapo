# ZAPO Recipes

## Overview

We are building a simple recipe web application that allows users to input recipes into our database. This list of recipes can then be viewed and filtered in the DOM. As a stretch goal, users will be able to rate these recipes.

## User Stories

As a user who is interested in finding new recipes:
- [ ] I want to see a list of recipes I can pick from
- [ ] I'd like to see instructions, the ingredients and the cuisine of the recipe
- [ ] I'd like to be able to search by cuisine
- [ ] **Stretch Goal** I'd like to be able to search by ingredients
- [ ] **Stretch Goal** I'd like to be able to see recipe ratings and rate them myself

As a user who likes to share my recipes:
- [ ] I'd like to be able to input my favourite recipes into a database so others can try them
- [ ] I'd like to specify instructions, the ingredients and the cuisine of the recipe
- [ ] **Stretch Goal** I'd like to be able to get feedback on my recipes
